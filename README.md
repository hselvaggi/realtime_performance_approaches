The intention of the following source code is to just to show how the use of multiprocessing as well as threading can help achieve high performance on real time applications in python.

#### nonmultiprocessing.py

The first example does not use either multiprocessing nor threading


#### withmultiprocessing.py

Multiprocessing example

#### withmultiprocessingandthreading.py

Multiprocessing and multithreading: 
    

#### advancedmultiprocessingandthreading.py

This example shows how the creation of higher level abstractions can simplify source code
